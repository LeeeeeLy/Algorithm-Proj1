# Project 1 - Xiaowen Li


## Instruction

This project was written in Python 3.9, compiles through Windows cmd with parameters to select which sorting algorithm, size, and type of data. ex.

```bash
C:\Location>python project1.py i 30000 s
Sorting 30000 numbers of sorted data with insertionsort takes:
0:00:00.004012
Data correctly sorted after running <insertionsort>.
```
There is also a script runp.py that allows running all testing cases in parallel.
```bash
C:\Location>python runp.py
Sorting 10000 numbers of sorted data with selectionslot takes:
0:00:02.554205
Data correctly sorted after running <selectionslot>.
Sorting 20000 numbers of sorted data with selectionslot takes:
0:00:10.321392
Data correctly sorted after running <selectionslot>.
Sorting 30000 numbers of sorted data with selectionslot takes:
0:00:23.634819
Data correctly sorted after running <selectionslot>.
Sorting 40000 numbers of sorted data with selectionslot takes:
0:00:42.038588
Data correctly sorted after running <selectionslot>.
Sorting 50000 numbers of sorted data with selectionslot takes:
0:01:06.618693
Data correctly sorted after running <selectionslot>.
Sorting 60000 numbers of sorted data with selectionslot takes:
0:01:36.000317
Data correctly sorted after running <selectionslot>.
